          <h1 className='font-bold my-5 text-tiger-yellow'>Terms and Conditions of Blogwrite</h1>
          <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
          <p className='pb-2 pl-4'>By accessing Blogwrite, you agree to these legally binding terms, which you acknowledge you have read faster than a superhero reads their comic books.</p>
          <h2>2. Changes to Terms</h2>
          <p className='pb-2 pl-4'>We may update these terms as frequently as a chameleon changes colors. It's your responsibility to check them out – consider it your daily dose of fine print.</p>
          <h2>3. User Conduct</h2>
          <ul className='pb-2 pl-4'>
            <li><strong>Be Nice</strong>: Leave the trolling to the fishermen.</li>
            <li><strong>No Robots Allowed</strong>: Unless they're here to tell jokes.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep it Clean</strong>: If your grandma wouldn't approve, don't post it.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>4. Content Ownership</h2>
          <p className='pb-2 pl-4'>You own your content, but by posting, you give us a free pass to share it with the world, the universe, or even extraterrestrials.</p>
          <h2>5. Liability Limitation</h2>
          <p className='pb-2 pl-4'>If our website causes your device to turn into a pumpkin at midnight, we're not liable. Also, we're not responsible for coffee spills or cookie crumbs on your keyboard.</p>
          <h2>6. Third-Party Links</h2>
          <p className='pb-2 pl-4'>Clicking on third-party links is like teleporting – we don't control the destination, so travel at your own risk.</p>
          <h2>7. Termination</h2>
          <p className='pb-2 pl-4'>If you turn to the dark side, we may have to use our Jedi powers to deactivate your account.</p>
          <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
          <p className='pb-2 pl-4'>These terms are governed by the laws of the Internet, which are made up of cat videos and memes.</p>
          <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
          <p className='pb-2 pl-4'>If you have any questions, send us a carrier pigeon or use modern technology to email us.</p>
          <p><em>Remember</em>: write responsibly and enjoy Blogwrite!</p>

        <div className="privacy-policy">
          <h1 className='font-bold my-5 text-tiger-yellow'>Privacy Policy of Blogwrite</h1>
          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p className='pb-2 pl-4'>Welcome to the privacy policy of Blogwrite, where we protect your data like a dragon hoards treasure – fiercely and with a little bit of fire.</p>
          <h2>2. Personal Information Collection</h2>
          <p className='pb-2 pl-4'>We collect your info (like name and email) for a good laugh, not for sending you to the dark web. We promise not to sell your secrets to intergalactic traders.</p>
          <h2>3. Use of Information</h2>
          <p className='pb-2 pl-4'>We use your data to personalize your experience, like knowing your favorite joke genre. It's all in the name of fun – no funny business.</p>
          <h2>4. Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
          <p className='pb-2 pl-4'>Our cookies are digital, not edible. They help us remember your preferences, like whether you laugh at dad jokes or not.</p>
          <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
          <p className='pb-2 pl-4'>We guard your data like a knight in shining armor. Our security is tougher than a two-dollar steak.</p>
          <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p className='pb-2 pl-4'>We partner with other jesters and jokesters, but only those who take privacy as seriously as we take puns.</p>
          <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
          <p className='pb-2 pl-4'>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your data, and to tell us if you don't find our jokes funny (but that might hurt our feelings).</p>
          <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
          <p className='pb-2 pl-4'>We may update this policy more often than a comedian updates their jokes. Stay tuned for the latest version.</p>
          <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
          <p className='pb-2 pl-4'>If you have any privacy concerns or just want to share a good joke, reach out to us. We're all ears (and laughs).</p>
          <p><em>Remember</em>: Your privacy is no joke to us at Blogwrite. We're committed to keeping your data safe and secure!</p>
